# JS-Tools

This tool has unexpectedly become the most used program I have made. I use the pin-to-top feature almost daily.


<style>li {list-style-type: none;}</style>

## Controls:
WIN+SPC: change window transparency

CTRL+SPC: Pin window to top

WIN+C: display color mouse is hovering over
* f12: copy color

ctrl+arrow: move mouse

ctrl+numpad: change speed of mouse
